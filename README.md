# Ganilues Toolkit · Image Converter

A standalone web app for converting, viewing, inspecting and resizing images.
It runs entirely in the browser: files never leave your device, there is no server, and it works offline.

## Features

- **Convert** between image formats (see the table below), one file or a whole batch at once.
- **View** images with zoom (fit, 100%, zoom in/out) on a transparency checkerboard.
- **Inspect** each file: its real format (detected from the file's bytes, so a mislabelled extension is flagged), MIME type, file size, dimensions, megapixels, aspect ratio, transparency, and camera EXIF data for JPEGs (make, model, date, orientation, software).
- **Resize** by percentage, to fit inside a box (keeps proportions), or to an exact size, with presets.
- **Rotate and flip.**
- **Quality** control for JPEG, WebP, AVIF and PDF. **Background colour** for formats without transparency. **DPI** for EPS, PDF, TIFF and BMP.
- Drag and drop, file picker, or paste from the clipboard (Ctrl+V).

## Supported formats

| Format | Open | Save as | Notes |
|---|:-:|:-:|---|
| JPEG | ✅ | ✅ | |
| PNG | ✅ | ✅ | |
| WebP | ✅ | ✅ | |
| GIF | ✅ (first frame) | ✅ | 256-colour palette, 1-bit transparency |
| BMP | ✅ | ✅ | 24-bit |
| TIFF | ✅ | ✅ | Opens LZW, Deflate, PackBits and uncompressed TIFFs; saves uncompressed RGBA |
| ICO | ✅ | ✅ | Saves a multi-size icon (16–256 px), good for favicons |
| SVG | ✅ | ✅ | Saved SVGs embed the image. They are not traced into vector paths |
| EPS | ℹ️ info only | ✅ | PostScript Level 2, opens in Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Affinity, etc. |
| PDF | ℹ️ info only | ✅ | One-page PDF, page size from the DPI setting |
| AVIF | ✅ | ✅ where supported | Saving depends on the browser (button is greyed out if not available) |
| HEIC | ✅ in Safari | — | Other browsers can't open HEIC |
| PSD, PS | ℹ️ info only | — | |

## Run it

No build step and no install. Either:

- **Double-click `index.html`.** It works straight from disk, offline.
- **Serve the folder** with any static web server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server` and open <http://localhost:8000>.
- **Publish it with GitHub Pages:** repository *Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch*, pick the branch and `/ (root)`.

## Project layout

```
index.html          Page layout
css/styles.css      Styling (light and dark mode)
js/detect.js        Format detection from magic bytes, EXIF reader
js/encoders.js      Output encoders (BMP, TIFF, ICO, GIF, EPS, PDF and SVG are written by hand; the rest use the browser)
js/app.js           UI, preview, resize/rotate pipeline, conversion
js/vendor/          UTIF.js (TIFF decoding) and pako (Deflate), both MIT-licensed
```

## Limitations

- **Raster to vector:** EPS, PDF and SVG output contain the original pixels. Turning a photo or logo into real vector paths (tracing) is a separate feature that could be added later.
- **Opening EPS/PDF/PSD** files as images would need a much heavier engine (e.g. Ghostscript compiled to WebAssembly). The app shows their file details but cannot preview them.
- **Animated GIF/WebP:** only the first frame is converted.
- **Size:** very large images are capped at 16,384 px per side (a browser canvas limit).
